# Website Task Brief.

Build the frontend for a homepage Figma design using HTML and CSS. Focus is accuracy and desktop version. Free to add creative touches.

No backend, limited responsiveness, limited cross-browser testing needed.

## Details.

1.   Optimised for Chrome with some attention to Safari.
2.   Some JQuery added for submenus and closing top banner.
3.   Basic & subtle CSS animations added on titles in keeping with elegant design, using ``view()``. 
4.   Optimised images via Photoshop batch image processing.
5.   Rudimentary responsiveness and accessibilty added for desktop. No media queries for mobile. 

## Issues & Challenges.

I encountered the following during the build, which I would've discussed with colleagues. I chose not to implement my own solutions without discussion in these instances:

1. It might not be possible to input a check-in datetime and check-out datetime in one field. Perhaps, two datetime inputs might be needed assuming the backend automates the check. But I would welcome knowing how to keep a single field. I've kept it as a text input for now, not knowing if the backend will be automated feedback or not. 
2. To load images centred in the explore section and enable scrolling to the hidden image on the left (Newcastle) might not be possible without JS. 
3. Figma rendering of fonts appears to be different to Chrome. Letter spacing is particularly obvious. I wondered if this needs to be increased to achieve the same visual effect? 
4. Some spacing was not explicitly defined in Figma (or atleast I couldn't spot it, apologies). So I've done my best to approximate. 

## Closing Reflections.

Compliments to the designer: beautiful & elegant design, stylish and classy, and has enticed me to visit Dakota. A pleasure to work on. Really enjoyed the build.
